### Hello! Welcome to my repository!

After a 15 year career as a teacher and assistant principal, I enrolled in the data science program at the Flatiron School to take my data skills to the next level. I graduated this winter, and now, I am looking for a data analyst or data scientist position where I can contribute my technical skills and experience.

### Highlighted Projects:

[Linking Writing Process and Writing Quality](https://github.com/ahendricks2/EssayKeystrokes): The goal of this project is to predict the final score of an essay based on the writer's keystroke behaviors alone (with no access to the content of the essay). Some of the main tools I use in this project are Pandas for preprocessing and scikit-learn for modeling. I include a non-technical presentation, found in the readme, to share insights from the analysis.

[Predicting NBA Player Points](https://github.com/ahendricks2/Capstone): For this project, my capstone at the Flatiron School, I predict how many points an NBA player will score in his next game based on over 200k box score records. My work in this project includes web scraping with requests, preprocessing with Pandas, and modeling with scikit-learn. Here, I again include a non-technical presentation, found in the readme, to share insights from the analysis.

[Investing Movie Budgets](https://github.com/ahendricks2/MovieBudgetOptimization): In this project, I investigate the profitability of three possible strategies for investing movie budgets based on about 5k records related to movie budget and profitability. The project shows off my ability to do hypothesis testing, to use inferential statistics and to work with MS Excel.
